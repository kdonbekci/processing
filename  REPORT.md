## Goals
1. Experiment with visualizations of simulations to be better equipped with tools to communicate complex models.

## Approach
Well, all I did was to play around what [Processing](https://processing.org/) has to offer and try to visualize some classic hunter vs prey simulation models.

## Outcome
Processing was very fun to learn and easy to pick up if one has prior Javascript experience. The visualizations were quite enjoyable and processing.js will be in my toolkit for making data and analysis easier to communicate.
